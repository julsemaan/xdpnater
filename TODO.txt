- DonÂ´t try to NAT 255.255.255.255
- Allow to configure which interfaces to setup the program on
- Free natport on TCP close
- Free natport on ICMP reply
- Check if natport entry is older than X time before using it again
- Replace log.Fatalf in xdpnater
- ip/mac allowlist for being NATed, XDP_PASS otherwise (or allow configuring XDP_DROP)
- Source IP rate limit for requesting NAT ports

X Perform cleanup of old entries in NAT table
  X Counter increments on every natport added, decrements when one is freed (TCP). Counter needs spinlock
  X User space watches for that counter, when it had increased of x since the last clean, it cleans and records the counter. Need to handle a u64 reset to 0
